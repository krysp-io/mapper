A <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> node can be used to modify a messageâ€™s properties and set context properties without having to resort to a Function node.

Each node can be configured with multiple operations that are applied in order. The available operations are:

Set - set a property. The value can be a variety of different types, or can be taken from an existing message or context property.
Move - move or rename a property.

# Install
-------

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

        npm install node-red-contrib-field-mapper

Or else install the package directly from Manage Palette
